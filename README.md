### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Noah, and I go by Ploverums online.
I'm a developer who specializes in Javascript and C#. I've worked on multiple Unity game projects that have won state and national awards, and also work as a Javascript coding instructor. Currently, I'm working as the Curriculum Director at LingHacks V, the world's first Computational Linguistics hackathon. I hope you enjoy my work on display here!
